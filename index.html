          <br /><br />Black Blood is a piece of work that deals with Tom Roche’s
          longing to understand his Romany Gypsy roots. A fragmented history and
          snippets of stories heard through the years of his childhood brought
          about questions years later, that could not be answered. Incomplete
          records and hypnotic familial anecdotes led him to change his
          approach; from that of a formal investigation, into more of a
          folkloric and esoteric meditation. <br /><br />The prophet of Abram,
          written about in The Dialect of the Gypsies of Wales, was said to be
          the leader of the Welsh Romany clan, where Roche’s family lived a
          century ago. The mysticism of Abram and the untold stories reflect
          that of the work Tom is trying to make on his own understanding of
          where he sits in time.<br /><br />
          Kaulo Ratti (Black blood), translated to mean a Gypsy of the purest
          type, plays with the dichotomy that Roche faces with the distance
          between him and his predecessors.
